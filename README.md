### Where does M1 Finance fit in the Fintech space
---
M1 Finance is considered to a robo-advisor however that is loosely defined as investor choose their own mix of stocks, etfs, and mutual funds and weight them to their own specification in what they call a *"pie"*. This differs from other robo-advisors in the space such as Acorns, Betterment, MoneyLion etc. where the portfolios are pre-built and managed for the investor. 

The core feature of M1 Finance is their *pie* distibution with this they encourage investors to dollar cost average into their *pie* with the new money the dynamically rebalance by investing in areas of their pie that are underweight from target allocation and thus over time adjust the weighting back to their targets without incurring additional tax events that would be triggered with the traditional way of rebalancing. In some cases where a particular stock has gone up very quickly or a position is removed from the *pie* they have a single click rebalance that smartly determines the best way to bring the portfolio back into balance.

## Trends among Robo-Advising space
---
The robo-advising space in among fintech is branching in many directions and is now moving towards a one place to do all your financial needs in personal tech. In the first wave they mainly focused on a singular offering with niche spin on that offering services such as Acorns, Stash, Betterment came up with a offering focusing on managing a portfolio where you dollar cost average into a portfolio with a concept of roundups. Other companies started on the lending side of the business helping people secure lower rates based on factors other than credit scores. However, now it seems that all companies are integrating all these service offering in their own apps and services with their own twist on the idea. The day of a single product offering with a unique niche way of doing something is dead a single space utilizing multiple marketing ideas such as roundups, crypto, lending and investing need to be under a singular roof utilizing proprietary methods not used to reach new customers and consumers not served in traditional finance companies such as large banks, credit unions, and brokerage companies.

## Reccommendations to stay relevant and innovate using their core *pie* strategy
---
To stay relevant and to maintain unique niche competitive advantage M1 Finance will need to expand their offering to allow for a on-demand trading allowing the use of immediate market/limit orders to be part of their *pie* offering. The trading portion option should allow options trading to compete with competitors such as Robinhood,WeBull, and MooMoo apps that all allow these trades. M1 Finance could supercharge this by allowing it to be part of their pie but sectioned off to allow for immediate trades and to keep more of the customer time spent on financial transactions within their app.

Crypto should be another asset class they add to the arsenal of financial instruments that can be added to the *pie* infrastructure as it is one of the hottest trends and with more and more of the big money getting into that space the more likely is for it to become regulated than outlawed. This would directly compete with Coinbase, Gemini and Blockfi to name a few. Their are caveats to this in that the regulations are not quite defined within the US regulatory space as several other fintech disruptors have found out. So moving cautiosly within this space is reccommended

Being an app only product is a quick method to becoming relevant and drive viral growth quickly among the millenial and GenZ crowds it does hinder other demographic populations that are aging say GenX nearing retirement and high earning years and the Boomer generations which is almost exclusively retired at this point. 

Growth in the insuretech space as it relates to personal finance should be looked at for the company especially as it relates to whole and universal life insurance as that space is still staunchly untouched by fintech innovation at this time. Their are several niche ways to innovate in this space and to leverage that innovation to meet the needs of the infinite banking community.
